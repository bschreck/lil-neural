# Lil Neural, the illest rapper alive

Lil Neural don't need DNA
to drink Aliz√©,
make out your girl erryday
sell out stadiums and make more
rap lyrics

Lil neural picks words so quick
you gotta predict he was not intermixed
from the old sloppy play of chicks and dicks
rather
just assembled
mesh of old lyrics in order to resemble
old school rappers in the flesh and in the blood
running on electrons
gunning for respect on
the highest stage
in effect direct rejection
of the longest evolution
to be the one and only
rapper perfected
